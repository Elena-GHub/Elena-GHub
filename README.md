## Welcome to my GitHub Space

I am a Full Stack Developer freshly graduated from [Factoria F5](http://www.factoriaf5.org/).<br>
After learning the basics of coding in **php**, regardless the language, my aim is now more TDD and clean code.<br>
We also worked a couple of separate "exploring" sprints to check out other languages such as **Python** and **Go**.
