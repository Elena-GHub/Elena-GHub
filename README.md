I am a Full Stack Developer freshly graduated from [Factoria F5](http://www.factoriaf5.org/).<br>
After learning the basics of coding in **php**, regardless the language, my aim is now more TDD and clean code.<br>
We also had the chance to "dip our feet" in other languages such as **Python** and **Go** over two separate "exploring" sprints.
